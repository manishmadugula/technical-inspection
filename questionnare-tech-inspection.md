# Building

# Maintenance

- Fence door lock not working ( fence door lock (sliding locks are present at the top and bottom)

# electricity
- Do large consumers of electricity, such as the washing machine, dryer, hob and oven, have their own group? This prevents overloading when you use them at the same time.
- Step into the meter cupboard and check if there is a separate group for all kitchen appliances and, if you are in an old house, an earth leakage switch
- Where is the fiber, in the house?
- Electrical connections
- Is there proper earthing?
    - Does the meter box have enough earth leakage circuit breakers and are they grounded? A maximum of four groups per circuit breaker may be connected.

# bathroom
- Water pressure
- Mold formation
- Drain, gutter clog?

# Fixes

- Moisture penetration on the bedroom window (re-caulked and fixed it)?
- 2015 bathroom drain leak due to crack 2017, shower water pipe break, replace pipe
- Electrical cables pulled to garden from meter cupboard (1 of which was damaged during emergency fence 
repair during storm)
- Fence door lock not working ( fence door lock (sliding locks are present at the top and bottom)
- insulating glazing throughout the house (no? : is it only the bathroom?)


# Energy Savings
## HR Glass
- Is the Glass thick enough for storms and burglary? reinforced back gate.
- Can I change the glass myself, the interior glass in the living space? Or is it handled by VVE?
- Cost to change it to HR++? 
- Material window frame is made of?


## Insulation
- There is roof, facade and floor insulation but is it enough for fully electric heat pump?
- Installed on 2008, is it HR107 boiler?
- Fully electric or hybrid heat pump?
- Can I have solar boiler even without solar panel?
- Which should I get heat pump, solar boiler or hybrid? 
    - HR107  boiler
    - CV Boiler
    - Heat pump
    - Solar boiler
    - hybrid boiler
    - VR  combination  boiler  vs HR Combination boiler
- Gas was 511m3, and electricity total : 2779 Watts
- Perhaps I should go with HR++ in living room and hybrid heat pump (with HR Boiler).
-  insulating glazing throughout the house (no? : is it only the bathroom?)

## Solar panel
- Is it handled by VVE? Where is the place since the roof is owned by neighbour.
- Can any solar equipment be installed since roof is not owned?


# Security
- Need to upgrade security, can I do that without VVE?

# VVE
- Does interior renovation to bathroom and kitchen require permission from VVE? What about renovation to backyard?
- Nearby construction?
- VVE cost 200,000
- What is the roof replacement (Roofing APP + ballast, Dakdoorvoer ), will that give insulation?

# Insurance
- What is covered by the insurance?
